 # My Django Project

This project is a Django application for Task Management.
It is a backend project built with Django and Django REST Framework, designed to allow users to manage their tasks efficiently. It provides a set of endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, with attributes such as title, description, due date, priority, and status. 
Users can also mark tasks as complete or incomplete and filter or sort tasks based on various criteria. The API includes user authentication, ensuring secure access to each userâ€™s tasks, and employs proper error handling with HTTP status codes. 
This project aims to deliver a robust, scalable, and secure solution for task management in both development and production environments.
